## TestApp

This project is an app made in Flutter as a test. It contains 2 screens, one that simulates a login, with some restrictions, for example: the user can log in if the 2 fields (password and username) are not empty, if the password has more than 2 characters and if there is no space as a final character in either field. On this screen there is also a privacy policy button, which sends the user to the Google website. This screen uses a mockAPI to verify the data entered by the user. The other screen is an annotation screen, where the user can enter text to be added to a card. This screen was created using MoBX for state management and SharedPreferences to keep user data on the device even after closing the application.

### How to Run

You will need <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter</a>, after booting up on your emulator or device and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab">starting a new Flutter project</a>, you will transfer the files of this repository folder of your Flutter project. As the project started in 2022, it will be necessary to roll back to an 
older version of Flutter (v 3.13.9). Some other adjustments may also be necessary due to incompatibility.
